# Anticheat-Detections
### **Methods to detect nearly every public anticheat!**

#### Some methods may be outdated, please make an [issue](https://github.com/PhoenixHaven/Anticheat-Detections/issues) if this is true.
#### Any suggestions and new detections are welcome too, but please mark them as so.

This is Work In Progress and will be worked on in the future.

Now without further ado; here's a table of all current detections.
