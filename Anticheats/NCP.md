# NCP
I can't find the newest sources of NCP / any support discords.
## Anticheat Notes
- It's NCP. Enough said.

## How to detect
- NCP will always lag you back onto your last ground position unless the server has something else to drag you down. 
- NCP will deal fall damage regardless of what the client tells the server. This is usually an easy way to recognize that it is NCP. An easy way to differentiate this from other anticheats that deal fall damage like this (ex: Hawk), is that NCP has very strict lowhop checks.
- How to differentiate NCP from other anticheats like intave that deal fall damage regardless of client state? NCP has no strafe checks, as well as very lenient speed and timer checks.


## Updated NCP
- An easy way to differentiate updated NCP vs NCP is using 0.42 constant motion tower, updated NCP has this patched as well as slime fly.
- Updated NCP also is vulnerable to spoof nofall's, this will not reduce all damage but significantly reduces the damage taken.
