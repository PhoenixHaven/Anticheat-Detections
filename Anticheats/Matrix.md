## Anticheat Notes
- Matrix is... just... yeah.

## How to detect
- Matrix will send 1 transaction every 30 seconds or 11 seconds
- Matrix will summon an Anti-Killaura bot if you flag combat.
- Matrix lagbacks function similarly to NCP, however it handles fall damage based on client state.
- Matrix has strafe semi-strict strafe checks, and will detect ground strafe if there is a large enough difference.
